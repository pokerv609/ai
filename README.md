- [AI For Everyone](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-for-everyone)

This course is a fantastic introduction to artificial intelligence, breaking down complex terms such as neural networks, deep learning, and machine learning in a way that’s easy to grasp. It clears up common confusion around these buzzwords and explains key concepts, such as the difference between supervised learning (where AI learns from labeled examples) and unsupervised learning (where AI finds patterns on its own). The course also highlights how data analytics differs from machine learning and outlines the distinct roles of data analysts, machine learning engineers, and machine learning researchers. I’d love to see future updates include generative AI and the emerging roles of Generative AI Engineers/Researchers.

  Generative AI for Everyone explains how modern generative models like large language models work and how they’re applied in real situations. Andrew Ng breaks down that these systems don’t “understand” meaning — they generate text by predicting the next most likely token based on patterns learned from huge datasets. This explains why they can produce impressive results while still hallucinating or making confident mistakes.
  The course highlights three main approaches to using generative AI in organizations: using foundation models directly, fine-tuning them on specialized data, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), where a model retrieves information from an external knowledge base instead of relying only on what it was trained on. A key takeaway is that RAG is often the most practical solution for businesses, because it avoids the cost and complexity of training large models from scratch while providing more accurate, grounded responses.
  Andrew also focuses on how generative AI changes workflows and jobs. Instead of fully replacing roles, AI automates specific tasks and shifts human work toward oversight, creativity, and complex decision-making. The course emphasizes building cross-functional teams, rapid iteration, and selecting narrow, high-impact projects instead of broad, unfocused goals.
  Finally, the course addresses safety and ethics: bias in training data, accountability for model outputs, responsible deployment, and transparency. The message is that generative AI can create major value, but only when applied thoughtfully and with clear guardrails.

This course is a fantastic introduction to artificial intelligence, breaking down complex terms such as neural networks, deep learning, and machine learning in a way that’s easy to grasp. It clears up common confusion around these buzzwords and explains key concepts, such as the difference between supervised learning (where AI learns from labeled examples) and unsupervised learning (where AI finds patterns on its own). The course also highlights how data analytics differs from machine learning and outlines the distinct roles of data analysts, machine learning engineers, and machine learning researchers. I’d love to see future updates include generative AI and the emerging roles of Generative AI Engineers/Researchers.
